HL Twitter stores tweets from multiple accounts and displays them via a customisable widget as well as supprting auto-tweeting new posts.

== Description ==

HL Twitter lets you display your tweets as a widget in your sidebar. But it also does a whole lot more. You can track multiple Twitter accounts and store all of the tweets on your blog indefinitely (currently Twitter only keep your 3,200 most recent tweets) as well as pulling in any tweets that you reply to for future reference. You can then tweet from your Dashboard or have HL Twitter automatically tweet your new posts with a customisable message.

== Installation ==

1. Upload hl_twitter directory to your /wp-content/plugins directory
2. Activate plugin in WordPress admin
3. In WordPress admin, go to Twitter. You will be asked to link the plugin to your Twitter account.
4. Add the user(s) you wish to store tweets for. You can also import their most recent tweets.
5. To tweet from within WordPress visit the WordPress Admin Dashboard or look at the bottom of a Post page

To modify the widget theme:

1. Copy the hl_twitter_widget.php file from /wp-content/plugins/hl_twitter to /wp-content/themes/*your-current-theme*/
2. Edit the new hl_twitter_widget.php file in your theme directory
3. You can now update the plugin as normal and your changes will not be overwritten

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can I only import 3,200 tweets? =

Twitter currently limit access to the 3,200 most recent tweets for an account. If they increase this limit, HL Twitter will also increase.

= Why aren't all my tweets being pulled in? =

Twitter limits applications to a set number of requests per hour. If you are tracking a lot of people you may hit this limit before HL Twitter has finished importing all new tweets.

= How do I enable auto-tweeting? =

Auto-tweeting, having HL Twitter tweet a new message whenever you publish a post or page, is disabled by default. To enable it go to Twitter -> Settings in your WordPress admin. You can also change the default text that is shown in the tweet. When publishing a new post or page, you will not be able to choose whether or not to tweet for this post.
